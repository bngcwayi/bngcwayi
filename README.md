## My Work 💼

### [React Portfolio](https://projectv4-51f3d.firebaseapp.com/)

✓ This is my personal website portfolio. I'm incredibly proud to share this milestone with you. Creating this personal portfolio from scratch was both challenging and rewarding. Ensuring it truly represents me, I aimed to create an experience where visitors feel like they know me and understand what I'm about.

### [Naruto Uzumaki](https://snazzy-froyo-38dcc6.netlify.app/)

✓ This is my second project I am most proud of, and it's a tribute page dedicated to Naruto Uzumaki. I chose Naruto as the subject because he's an anime hero who faces many challenges but never gives up. Creating this tribute page was not only a way to honor Naruto but also served as a personal reminder to stay determined and resilient, even when faced with adversity. It's a reminder to keep pushing forward on my own journey, no matter what obstacles come my way.
